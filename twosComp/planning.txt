Hows twos complement works.

Twos complement is a way to find a negative number in binary. Firstly, you need to find the number in binary. For this we'll use 8 bit a nibble (or half a byte)


'8 4 2 1'

For this we will use number : n = 5 or '0 1 0 1

To make it into twos complement, we need to invert the binary :

1 0 1 0

The leftmost position being used to show it's a negative number in binary.

We then must add '1' to the right position. If there is a '1' in the right position it will go to the next position till it reaches a 0. All 1s between the 
start and final destination will go to '0'

For example:

1 0 1 1

will turn to 

1 1 0 0 

Anyway, back to the problem. 

We have made the binary to negative ( 1 0 1 0 )

and we now must add '1' that will turn to:

1 0 1 1

In finally, 1 0 1 1 is -10 in binary.



2s comp to Dewi Decimal:

you do the same as 2s comp. you flip and add 1 
(you must do that on the 2s comp binary. If you were to do that on the standard positive binary you'd justs get the twos comp)

Add binary to a list

Loop thorough the list as 'i'. If i == 1 then change to a 0 and vice versa. 

Add 1 to the end of the list. 
If its already a 1 then loop from the reverse of the list and find the closest 0. then go from the 
location of the 0 and and end of the list and replace it with 0
